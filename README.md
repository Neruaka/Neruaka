## 🧑‍💻 About me

- I like turning real business problems into data-driven applications (dashboards, internal tools, APIs).
- I work across the stack: from data modelling and backend APIs to front-end UIs in React.
- I am building strong foundations in machine learning, data engineering and software craftsmanship.
- Currently looking to grow in **Data Engineering / ML Engineering / MLOps** roles.
